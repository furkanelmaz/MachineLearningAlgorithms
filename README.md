# MachineLearningAlgorithms
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch in Python.

This repository contains from scratch implementation (only using numpy and pandas) of several conventional machine learning methods. The repository is created for educational purposes only to understand the underlying mathematics of these techniques and to see vanilla implementations. Thus, efficiency was not a concern and should not be expected.  

Because Neural Network-based implementations get frustrating pretty quickly, especially for deep models, when the implementation efficiency is poor, they are not given in this repository. Well developed frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow are better suited for these purposes. Such implementations can again be found in my other repository (ANN-Architectures-Pytorch).
